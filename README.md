# Rival Rebels **1.12.2 port**
### Ported by A weeb programmer

This is a port of the Rival Rebels mod which was originally created by Rodol Phito. After minecraft 1.8 came out, Rodol discontinued the development of the Rival Rebels mod
to make a game that was based off the mod. I was a big fan of Rival Rebels, so I thought "it would be cool if the mod was in later versions", and then I decided
to port the mod to 1.12.2. The 1.12.2 port also comes with a feature that the original mod didn't have which was the ability for items in the rival rebels mod
to interact with stuff from HBM's nuclear tech mod. I used the HBM API to be able to make items interact with the HBM nuclear tech mod.

__NOTICE: I know i said that this was discontinued before, but now, screw it, I wanna finish it__  
 
 **BUT** .... *I am rewriting the port on 1.18. You can find it [here](https://github.com/a-weeb-programmer/rival_rebels/tree/1.18)*
